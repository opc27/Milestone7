      <blockquote>
        “It would be the deepest desire of my heart to have every member of the
        Church be temple worthy. I would hope that every adult member would be
        worthy of—and carry—a current temple recommend.”
        <br />
        <strong> - President Howard W. Hunter</strong>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        To help you understand that you must be worthy to enter the temple and
        to reflect on your spiritual preparation.
      </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The temple is a sacred place where eternal covenants are made. Being
        worthy to enter the temple means living the gospel of Jesus Christ with
        integrity. This study will help you understand:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Moral Cleanliness</li>
        <li>Tithing</li>
        <li>The Word of Wisdom</li>
        <li>Keeping the Sabbath Day Holy</li>
        <li>The Temple Recommend Process</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Moral Cleanliness</h2>
      <p>
        The Lord has always emphasized purity. Moral cleanliness includes
        chastity before marriage and fidelity after marriage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scriptures:</strong> D&amp;C 42:22 - 24, D&amp;C 121:45, 1 Timothy
        4:12, 1 Nephi 10:21, Articles of Faith 1:13
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “We believe in chastity before marriage and total fidelity after
        marriage. That is the way to happiness in living.” - President Gordon B.
        Hinckley
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reflect: Why does the Lord emphasize moral cleanliness? What blessings
        come from living a pure life?
      </p>

      <h2>Tithing</h2>
      <p>
        Tithing is a principle of faith and gratitude. We return 10% of our
        income to the Lord to help build His kingdom.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scriptures:</strong> D&amp;C 119:4, Leviticus 27:30, Malachi
        3:8 - 11, D&amp;C 104:14
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Tithing… is a key to the opening of the windows of heaven… Members who
        do not tithe do not lose their membership; they only lose blessings.” -
        President James E. Faust
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reflect: How has paying tithing brought blessings into your life?
      </p>

      <h2>The Word of Wisdom</h2>
      <p>
        The Word of Wisdom helps us live in a way that supports both physical
        and spiritual well-being.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scriptures:</strong> 1 Corinthians 3:16 - 17, D&amp;C 89,
        D&amp;C 29:34
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “What you learn spiritually depends, to a degree, on how you treat your
        body… Tea, coffee, liquor, tobacco… interfere with spiritual
        communication.” - President Boyd K. Packer
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reflect: What habits are helping or hindering your physical and
        spiritual health?
      </p>

      <h2>The Sabbath Day</h2>
      <p>
        The Sabbath is a day of worship, rest, and renewal. Honoring it brings
        both spiritual and physical blessings.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Scriptures:</strong> Exodus 20:8 - 11, D&amp;C 59:9 - 13
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “Why honor the Sabbath? For rest and renewing, for spiritual
        regeneration, and as an expression of our love for God.” - Elder James
        E. Faust
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reflect: How do you personally honor the Sabbath? What blessings have
        you experienced from doing so?
      </p>

      <h2>The Temple Recommend Process</h2>
      <p>
        Being found worthy to enter the temple involves interviews with your
        bishop and a member of the stake presidency. This is a sacred
        opportunity to reflect and grow.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        “You can declare—or be helped to establish—your worthiness to enter the
        temple with the Lord's approval.” - Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple
      </blockquote>
      <p>Reflect on your personal worthiness in these areas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your testimony of Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost</li>
        <li>Support of Church leaders</li>
        <li>Keeping the commandments (tithing, chastity, Word of Wisdom, etc.)</li>
        <li>Honesty and integrity</li>
        <li>Church attendance and service</li>
        <li>Freedom from abuse or involvement with apostate groups</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <blockquote>
        “Establish the temple of the Lord as the great symbol of your
        membership… Be temple worthy. Carry a current temple recommend.” -
        President Howard W. Hunter
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Reflect: What changes do you need to make to be ready for the temple?
        How can you deepen your commitment today?
      </p>

      <p>
        Take time now to pray. Ask Heavenly Father to help you apply what
        you've studied. Invite the Spirit to confirm truth to your heart.
